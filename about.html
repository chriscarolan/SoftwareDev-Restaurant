    <p class="aboutUs">
        Marist Munchies has been serving the Marist community for over 10 years! Founded by four successful Marist
        alumni,our restaurant was made to add a fancy yet affordable dining experience to campus. In partnership with
        the Culinary Institute of America, we provide their students real life experience in our kitchens bringing some
        of the finest trained chefs, while also keeping our prices reasonable. With the Italian ambiance and the taste
        of the food, people feel like they are in Italy.
        <br>
        <br>
        Marist Munchies became “the spot to be” very quickly. Families, friends, alumni, and locals all enjoy our
        restaurant. The restaurant is perfect for unwinding after a busy day, a first date, or even simply a fun time
        with family and friends. Our restaurant is now one of the most talked about restaurants on campus. Due to this,
        reservations often need to be booked a month in advance; however, we also reserve half of our seating for
        walks-ins on a first-come first-served basis.
